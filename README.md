# EEG-connectivity-analysis
EEG signal Processing

This code can help you to analyse the EEG connectivity including Coherence, PDC, and isolated Coherence (iCoh).
Before runing the main function (an example named 'EEG_connectivity_processing'), please remember to:
1. Add the file fdMVAR_5order.m to your path.
2. Change the data locations.
